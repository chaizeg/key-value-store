# key-value-store

Personal project implementing a Key-Value Store using C++

NB : The project was inspired by a Build your own X project suggestion, so if you're looking for an interesting side project and you've never heard of build your own X before, here you go :https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x .
